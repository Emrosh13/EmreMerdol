										<h2>My very first game</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Pepe's Coin Quest was the very first project I ever 
										created. At the time, I was fascinated by platformer 
										games, so I naturally wanted my project to be a 
										platformer. Thankfully, my team approved of the idea, 
										and we decided to move forward with it. Working as a 
										group, we had about three weeks to complete the game. 
										The gameplay revolved around climbing a tower while 
										avoiding enemies, finding a hammer, using it to break 
										a box, retrieving a key, and unlocking a door to progress to the next level. Since this was our first project, we didn’t have time to design a second level. However, even with just one level, the game felt rewarding and enjoyable to play.</p>

										<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have any proper gameplay footage available 
											at the moment. Since it’s an older game, I deleted it to free up 
											space on my computer—an oversight I now regret. However, I’ll do 
											my best to track down some footage and update this page as soon 
											as I can!</p>

											<p>The footage below was recorded on my phone during the 
												development phase. Please note that some bugs and odd 
												movements might appear, but I hope you enjoy it 
												nonetheless! </p>

													<h2>Takeaways</h2>
												</header>
												<p>It’s worth mentioning that in this project, 
													I was responsible for both the movement 
													mechanics and animations. This experience 
													gave me valuable insight into how third-person 
													platformer movement works, as well as a deeper 
													understanding of animation within the Unity engine!</p>
