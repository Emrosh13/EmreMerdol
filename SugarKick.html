								<p>I'm proud to present the platformer game I
									 created during a 2-day game jam with three 
									 team members. The game features a single level 
									 where you play as a gingerbread man. Your goal is 
									 to clear the level by collecting candy. If you 
									 collect two candies in a row, you unlock a "super 
									 jump," allowing you to leap higher than usual. This 
									 special jump must be saved for specific parts of the 
									 level to successfully complete it.</p>

										<h2>My very first Game-Jam</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This was my very first game jam, and I was incredibly excited 
										to participate! The event had a tight 2-day timeframe, which 
										made things a bit stressful, but it was a lot of fun working 
										together with my team of four to create a platformer. 
										Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the code, as it was 
										stored on an old Perforce server provided through the school. 
										The server is restarted every year, and all projects are 
										deleted. However, Iâ€™m still excited to showcase some footage 
										of the game! I hope you look forward to it!</p>

													<h2>Takeaways</h2>
												</header>
												<p>Working on this platformer game was an incredibly rewarding 
													xperience! It demonstrated the power of consistent teamwork and 
													effective communication in achieving ambitious goals. 
													Our objective was to create a game reminiscent of classic 
													platformers like Mario or Wario Land, and I hope the provided 
													footage highlights these influences. This project not only 
													sharpened my skills in prototyping and collaboration but also 
													reinforced my passion for game development.</p>
